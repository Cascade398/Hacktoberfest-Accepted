/*
  Activity Selection Problem is a combinatorial optimization problem concerning the selection of non-conflicting activities, given their starting and finishing times. The problem is to select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single resource, assuming that only a single activity can use that resource at a time. A classic application of this problem is in scheduling a room for multiple competing events, or a resource for a process queue, each having its own time requirements (start and end time).
  
  This is a classic example of problem that can be solved by using the greedy-choice heuristic. What do we mean by the greedy choice for the activity-selection problem? Intuition suggests that we should choose an activity that leaves the resource available for as many other activities as possible. Hence, we must pick the activity which will finish first, because it will leave maximum amount of time for other resources.
  
  For example, assume we have 5 activities that wish to share a resource, along with their starting and finishing times:
      
      i |   START  |  FINISH
    ----+----------+-----------
      0 |     1    |    2
      1 |     2    |    4
      2 |     5    |    7
      3 |     3    |    4
      4 |     2    |    3
          
   The maximum possible number of activities that can be done is 3: activities 0, 2, and 4 can be done without any conflicts. Activities 0, 2, and 3 also make a valid answer set.
